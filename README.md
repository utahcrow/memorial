This is a memorial to my canine companion Sadie.
She was a Cocker Spaniel mix born in Georgia, lived in many states, and retired in Oregon.
She lived to the age of 18 years, 4 months, and 6 days before transitioning to the next world.
She was a mother to puppies, an adventurous soul, and the greatest dog I have known.
Rest in peace sweet Sadie.
You are always remembered.
